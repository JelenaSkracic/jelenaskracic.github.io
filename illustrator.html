    <p class="text"> Working in Illustrator was quite challenging for me. Since I was a kid I’ve been using computer mouse with my right hand but am left-handed, so drawing with my weaker hand wasn’t very succesfull for me. On the top of that I chose one of my nephews drawings to use as a templete and then the end result wasn’t that pleasing. Next time I will play smarter.
